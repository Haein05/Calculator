| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below: Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? Youtube videos and Google

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? I will focus on writing functions for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring to handle edge cases like division by zero. Following this, I will learn how to capture and validate user input from UI components. Finally, I will integrate the UI with the backend logic and thoroughly test the application for bugs and usability issues.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? I plan to submit a functional basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations. This demonstration software will include a user-friendly interface and handle common edge cases. The specific features and functionalities may evolve as the project progresses.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   M: 3-5PM Home W: 3-6PM Home T: 3-5PM Home F: 3-5PM Home S:1-2PM Home

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan? When integrating different components of the application, such as the user interface with the backend logic, it may encounter compatibility issues, data loss, or unexpected behavior. Use version control systems like Git to manage changes and track different versions of your application, allowing easy rollback if integration introduces bugs.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date | Start Time | IM or TP | Description          | Hours:Minutes |
|--| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| May 29 | 2:15       | IM       | study for code       | 2H 30Mins     |
| May 30 | 4:00       | IM       | start to make html   | 1H 30Mins     |
| May 31 | 10:30      | IM       | make script for java | 2H            |
| June 1 | 11:30      | IM       | study for code       | 1H            |
| June 3 | 5:00       | IM       | developing code      | 2H            |
| June 4 | 12:00      | IM       | developing, testing code|    2H      |
| June 5 | 3:20       | IM       | developing, testing code|   1H 20Mins|
| June 6 |  2:00      | IM       | developing, testing code|    1H      |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |----------|
| Are the links above public and working?                      | Yes      |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | Yes      |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I did not do the stretch challenge.
5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   No, I did  not change module during the middle of the Sprint.
6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module |     12H 20Minutes   |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   During this sprint, efficient time management helped me complete tasks successfully. However, I realized I waited too long to seek help with coding errors. Next sprint, I'll prioritize resolving issues independently but seek assistance promptly if needed, either from teammates or ChatGPT.
